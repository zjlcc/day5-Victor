## O (Observation)
Today, I worked with my mentor to clarify the requirements for the Parking Lot project, draft the context map, and implement the features step by step using TDD. By approaching the requirements from a real-world perspective, we incrementally added features and used TDD to ensure that the functionality and return results were correct.

## R (Reflection)
During the implementation process, I leveraged the knowledge I had previously learned and combined it with IDEA's shortcut keys, which significantly improved overall efficiency compared to before. Refactoring the code also became much easier. However, I still feel the need to explore ways to optimize the implementation further.

## I (Insight)
Consistently applying the knowledge I've learned has gradually transformed it into a skill that I can use intuitively. However, I realized that I need to deepen my understanding of design patterns, which could provide more elegant and efficient solutions to certain problems.

## D (Decision)
1. Start learning design patterns systematically to understand their use cases and benefits.
2. Review the current implementation in the project and identify areas where design patterns could be applied to improve the code.
3. Optimize the identified areas using appropriate design patterns.
4. Document the optimizations in an English Markdown file for future reference and sharing.
